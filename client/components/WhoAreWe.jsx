        or at least not the kind of dating site you'd expect after reading that. Our aim is to connect busy dog owners who don't have the time to walk their adorable pooches with 
        a dog lover who does not own a dog of their own. <br></br><br></br> Own a dog that needs some quality exercise time but don't have the time to do it yourself? Love taking dogs for walks but don't own one yourself?
        You're in the right place! Welcome to Follow My Lead!
